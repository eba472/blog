### Useful commands:
- **npm run dev**: Starts the development server.
- **npm run build**: Builds the app for production.
- **npm start**: Runs the built app in production mode.
- **npx next -v**: Check next version


### Next.js foundation course:


Consideration when building modern applications:

1. User Interface - how users will consume and interact with your application.
2. Routing - how users navigate between different parts of your application.
3. Data Fetching - where your data lives and how to get it.
4. Rendering - when and where you render static or dynamic content.
5. Integrations - what third-party services you use (CMS, auth, payments, etc) and how you connect to them.
6. Infrastructure - where you deploy, store, and run your application code (Serverless, CDN, Edge, etc).
7. Performance - how to optimize your application for end-users.
8. Scalability - how your application adapts as your team, data, and traffic grow.
9. Developer Experience - your team’s experience building and maintaining your application.

### Programming types
**Imperative programming** is like giving a chef step-by-step instructions on how to make a pizza. (Jquery DOM manipulation)
**Declarative programming** is like ordering a pizza without being concerned about the steps it takes to make the pizza. (ReactJS)

### Tools
**ReactJS**: Unopinionated declarative UI library
- **Components** allow you to build self-contained, reusable snippets of code (Lego bricks). This modularity allows your code to be more maintainable
- **Props**: Arguments to function. (Pass info)
- **Hooks**: allow you to add additional logic such as state to your components.
- **State**: any information in your UI that changes over time, usually triggered by user interaction.
**Next.js**: Flexible React framework. (No babel, instant refresh)
- Dev exp:  TypeScript and ESLint integration, Fast Refresh, and more.
- Production: Transform the code to make it performant and accessible. Application code needs to be compiled, bundled, minified, and code split. (compiler written in Rust)
**JSX** is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to describe your UI in a familiar HTML-like syntax.
**JavaScript compiler**, such as a **Babel**, to transform your JSX code into regular JavaScript.
**Facebook sdk**: 

### Vocabulary
**Compiling**: refers to the process of taking code in one language and outputting it in another language.
**Minification**: is the process of removing unnecessary code formatting and comments without changing the code’s functionality. Decrease file size
**Bundling**: is the process of resolving the web of dependencies and merging (or ‘packaging’) the files (or modules) into optimized bundles for the browser.
**Code-splitting**: splitting the application’s bundle into smaller chunks required by each entry point (urls) => improve the application's initial load time by only loading the code required to run.
**build your application**: transform your code into production-optimized files ready to be deployed to servers and consumed by users. (HTML, CSS, JS)
**Runtime** (or request time) refers to the period of time when your application runs in response to a user’s request, after your application has been built and deployed.
**Rendering**: convert the code you write in React into the HTML. The beauty of Next.js is that you can choose the most appropriate rendering method for your use case on a page-by-page basis
- Server-Side Rendering (Pre-Rendering): NextJS by default.  HTML is generated in advance, on a server
  - React 18 and Next 12 introduce an alpha version of React server components.
- Static Site Generation: content is generated once, at build time.
- Client-Side Rendering: Standard React. the browser receives an empty HTML shell from the server along with the JavaScript instructions to construct the UI.
  - Hydration: show a fast non-interactive page, while React uses the JSON data and JavaScript instructions to make components interactive
**CDNs** store static content (such as HTML and image files) in multiple locations around the world and are placed between the client and the origin server.
**Edge servers**. Similar to CDNs. can run small snippets of code. Reduced latency.

### NextJS
1. Navigation (No routing library required)
   1. Pages are associated with a route based on their file name in the **pages** directory.
   2. Link components to client-side navigate by JS. faster than browser (<a>). When <Link> appear in the browser’s viewport, Next.js prefetches the code for the linked page in the background.
   3. If you need to link to an external page outside the Next.js app, just use an <a> tag without Link.
2. Assets
   1. Next.js can serve static assets, like images, robots.txt, under the top-level public directory. 
   2. Image component is extension of <img>, handles responsive, optimize (WebP), lazy-loaded.
   3. Metadata (Use <Head>)
3. Third-Party JS such as facebook sdk can be added with Script tag
4. CSS
   1. component-lvl CSS is stored in .module.css files. 
   2. Global css must be imported inside _app.js
5. Rendering
   1. pre-rendering: better perf & SEO
      1. Static generation: html at build time (Blog, docs) (getStaticProps)
      2. Server-side rendering: html at each req
   2. Client-side: the same as old school React
6. Dynamic routes /blogs/[id] getStaticPaths
7. API routes as Node.js serverless function: not part of client bundle. Use case: form input as POST
