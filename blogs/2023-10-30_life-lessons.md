## Life Lessons
1. Anger never helps. Just walk instead of writing passive-aggressive messages.
2. I get angry with my closest ones when I am not productive during the day and watch videos all day. Pay attention!
3. When I am optimistic, I feel like I can do everything, and the world is in my palm. But life is really short, and we can accomplish very few things. We need to start moving.
4. It is good to spend money to be productive, such as in coffee shops.
